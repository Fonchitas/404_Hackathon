# Error 404: Mars not found
*Mission Objective: Major Tom was preparing to land on Mars when suddenly all systems went dark—only an error page remained: the planet Mars has vanished from the solar system. He was supposed to land in three minutes, but communications with Earth take ten. Your crew must design and develop the full responsive error 404 page that appears aboard his computer ship.*

## Goals & Objectives
- Create an interesting and interactive Error 404 website
- Find a main concept that can lead to the website's storytelling and engage with the user 
- Develop animations and interactivity

## Technologies Used 
For this project we combined HTML, CSS for styling and JavaScript for animations and interactions.

## Solution
We created a fun website where the user is put in the shoes of an astronaut whose spaceship is about to explode. In order to escape they need to click the window to break the glass, and it gradually breaks more and more untill they successfully escape.
